# diogenes-gate

unity version version:
     - 2020.3.29f1 [LTS]

modules added:
     - Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)

[the entire project folder is being pushed but the gitignore filters]

Note: i create a folder for this project locally, inside that folder created a (2D) project and name it Diogene's Gate.
this way when you pull it should go to the correct spot (will do my own testing to check)

we also need to test the gitIgnore to make sure we can make edits and work on all of our enviornments
